Current project structure

general_automation
- init
    - calls __main__
        Calls run

run
    - calls different flows - depending on whether its a deployment run, normal run or flow run
        calls main_flow
            calls runCodeList
                which calls runCode
                    which in turn calls runCodeList


New structure
main_flow
    calls a runStepInterpreter - which returns a commandObject - with info on the next step - key command and arguments
        add any validation here?
    calls a runCode - with commandObject as input - which processes the command step - returns commandObject.result?
