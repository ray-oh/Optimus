# Data Exploration

Data exploration involves data cleansing, transformation, wrangling and quick profiling and visualizations.
All these can be done with python pandas.  But there are a number of tools that make this easier without need for knowledge on python coding.
Commercial equivalents of such tools would be alteryx, tableau prep.  Which are proprietary and have a high license cost.

There are some a number of alternative open source options - which come at zero cost - and are more open in integration with python and pandas.  In fact many of such solutions are built upon standard pandas and other python libraries.
The following open source data exploration tools have been evaluated for integration with OPTIMUS, including:
- [mito](https://www.trymito.io/) This solution has been selected for inclusion in the OPTIMUS package as its the most mature among the evaluated tools in terms of user interface and features.  Here is an youtube video [review on mito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js4iaGQvTAo&list=PLtqF5YXg7GLkskjS9D2PSIwKV6HUuWkXo&index=14)
- [bamboolib](https://docs.bamboolib.8080labs.com/)
- [pandas GUI](https://github.com/adamerose/PandasGUI).  Youtube [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mSlETrcl8&list=PLtqF5YXg7GLkskjS9D2PSIwKV6HUuWkXo&index=20) on how to use PandasGUI for Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Science

# mito - automate entire spreadsheet workflows without having to learn Python

[mito](https://www.trymito.io/) is a GUI front end to python pandas for data analysis.  It provides a familiar EXCEL spreadsheet interface for automating python data analysis, without need to learn coding in python and pandas.

## Installing mito
Install the Mito installer:
```
python -m pip install mitoinstaller
```
Run installer:
```
python -m mitoinstaller install
```
Copy and run this in Jupyter Notebook:
```
import mitosheet
mitosheet.sheet()
```
Installation log.  Potential delay in installation due to expired certificate.
